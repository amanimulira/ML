training procedure :

define the neural network that has some learnable parameters ( or weights )

iterate over a dataset of inputs

process input through the network

compute the loss ( how far is the output from being correct )

propagate gradients back into the network's parameters

update the weights of the network, typically using a simple update rule: new_weights = weights - learning_rate * gradient
