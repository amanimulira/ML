## Machine Learning Projects 
using the pytorch libary in python I implement a series of deep learning algorithms & neural network topologies to better understands them, not just from a thoeoritical stand point but at a practical level from the RNNs, autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and even DQN network topology.
